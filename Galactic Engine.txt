Mix between space engine ( en.spaceengine.org/ ) and Spore
Large amounts of procedurally generated star systems, each with their own planets and other objects, each unique
Able to zoom in and out between planet-scaled objects and the whole galaxy
In galaxy view, see star clusters, nebulas, etc.
Zoom in more to see individual stars
Zoom in even more to see the star systems

Building it up:
Start with a planet, make it so that it's only visible when sufficiently close
Find a way to give it properties based on random numbers
Then build a star
Use the star as a light source for a semi-realistic shader for planets (good exercise for Graphics!)
Make it so that the star will be visible for further than the planet, but eventually will become too faint to see
Then build smaller objects, such as moons, comets, asteroids
Find a way to generate a solar system from random numbers
Create a second solar system
Create a small cluster of systems, which will be visible as one object for further than the individual stars
Create other celestial objects, such as gas clouds, neutron stars and black holes
Find a way to generate a complete galaxy out of random numbers

Profit!
Further ideas: RTS (space based strategy game), RPG-like game

How? C# + Coffee + Willpower + Google! (And time, lots and lots of time)
Good idea: Plan, plan and plan some more
